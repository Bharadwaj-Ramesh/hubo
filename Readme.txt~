 This file is in URDF Xacro format and several macro parameters
 especially path must be reset:

 --path: the current value is: 
   "file:///home/jingru/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/learning_urdf/dae/"
   you should change it to the path where you put the "dae" folder

 --effort: many joint in openHubo do not have torque limits, so set
   it to some default value, you many change it

 --lower: similar to the above but for joint lower bound

 --upper: similar to the above but for joint upper bound

 --to convert it to URDF format, use command:
 
   rosrun xacro xacro.py huboplus.xacro > huboplus.xml
